# Dynamic URL Routes

## Objectives

1. Explain how dynamic routes prevent web applications from having to be rewritten as new information is added
2. Create dynamic routes 

## Why Dynamic Routes?

When you create a new repository on GitHub, how do URLs like `github.com/jmburges/my-repo` get generated? In our current examples, we would have to create a new `if` statement for each possible URL path. Since this is a dynamic application, our application can't be rewritten every time a new user signs up. So the concept of "dynamic routes" was created.

## Setting Up Dynamic Routes

Let's assume we have a playlister app which has an array of Songs. First let's look at our `Song` object

```ruby
#song.rb

class Song

attr_accessor :title, :artist

end
```

Pretty simple class. Now we have our web app.

```ruby
class Application

  @@songs = [Song.new("Sorry", "Justin Bieber"),
            Song.new("Hello","Adele")]

  def call(env)
    resp = Rack::Response.new
    req = Rack::Request.new(env)
    
    @@songs.each do |song|
      resp.write "#{song.title}\n"
    end

    resp.finish
  end
end
```

We want more information about each song though. Similarily to GitHub, we want to be able to go to a URL like `localhost:9292/songs/Sorry` and get all the information on Sorry. We are doing routes like this instead of just plain `GET` params because it's easier to read. Remember the path is given to us as a `string`. We could therefore write something like this:


```ruby
class Application

  @@songs = [Song.new("Sorry", "Justin Bieber"),
            Song.new("Hello","Adele")]

  def call(env)
    resp = Rack::Response.new
    req = Rack::Request.new(env)

    if req.path=="/songs/Sorry"
      resp.write @@songs[0].artist
    elsif req.path == "/songs/Hello"
      resp.write @@songs[1].artist
    end

    resp.finish
  end
end
```

This is silly though, because every time we create a new `Song` we would have to create a new `if` statement. Thankfully, because paths are `strings`, we can do a regex match against the path. Then we just grab the content after the `/song/` to figure out which `Song` our user would like.


```ruby
class Application

  @@songs = [Song.new("Sorry", "Justin Bieber"),
            Song.new("Hello","Adele")]

  def call(env)
    resp = Rack::Response.new
    req = Rack::Request.new(env)

    if req.path.match(/songs/)

      song_title = req.path.split("/songs/").last #turn /songs/Sorry into Sorry
      song = @@songs.find{|s| s.title == song_title}

      resp.write song.artist
    end

    resp.finish
  end
end
```

Now our routes are dynamic! We can just add songs, and everything else is taken care of and works for us. Remembering that everything in Ruby is important. You have written a lot of Ruby; take comfort in your skills.
